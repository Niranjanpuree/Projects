Inactive,,,10070,0,0,0,,02.30.04,Los Alamos Landfill PH 2&,"The current repositories cannot hold any additional material – there is no place to expand.  A third repository needs to be designed and constructed to hold a minimum of  22,000 cubic yards.  This third repository will be constructed in the former clay borrow location.  In addition, the contractor will be required to obtain all necessary clearances from the local BLM office and the current oil and gas leasee, Williams Petroleum.   This may include the relocation of associated oil and gas well appurtenances.
 The contractor will be required to:
1)  design the repository, including all restoration features, in accordance with the 100% Engineering Design Document for the Phase II Repository Expansion.  
Upon completion and final approval of the final design of Phase III, the contractor will be required to: 
2)  haul all remaining shale from the main shale pile and the north shale pile and place it in the repository and then finish constructing the repository cover per approved design requirements.  
The contractor will also be required to:
3)  construct all restoration features in the former main shale and north shale areas, including the former ponding areas and the bottom land near Sharard Gulch.  This includes all stated benching, drainage swales, diversions, and culverts to slow stormwater flow and prevent major erosion of soil from the cliffside into Sharard Gulch and to prevent damage to the access road.

In February of 2018, damage was caused to a 1-mile long section of the static phase line of the Arizona Public Service Company (APS) Navajo-Westwing 500-2 500kV transmission line located near Black Canyon City, Yavapai County, Arizona. As a result, APS determined that emergency repairs were required to the transmission line in order to maintain operations and service to customers. Proposed construction repair activities included stringing a new static phase, removal of the damaged line, and improvement of dirt roads to enable access. Because this proposed work was scheduled to occur in the vicinity of known archaeological sites, APS and the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) requested that North Wind Resource Consulting (North Wind) provide archaeological monitoring during road improvements and work around cultural resource sites to protect sensitive resources and record any unanticipated discoveries.
This APS 500kV transmission line and associated right-of-way (ROW) cross or are in the vicinity of several previously-recorded archaeological sites located within the Agua Fria National Monument, which is managed by the BLM Phoenix District Office. The area of potential effect (APE) consists of utilized access roads and the APS 500kV transmission line ROW between APS structures 222/3 and 222/1.

Midvale Telephone Exchange (Midvale) proposes to install a 3.5-mile-long fiber-optic line in the City of Benson, Cochise County, Arizona. On behalf of Midvale, Monte R. Lee and Company (Monte R. Lee) contracted with North Wind Resource Consulting, Inc. (North Wind) to conduct a preliminary Class I survey to determine whether the fiber-optic alignment has previously surveyed. This information will be used to determine what areas of cultural sensitivity are located in the 3.5-mile long alignment and a 0.25-mile buffer around the alignment. 
This fiber-optic line will be located primarily underground, requiring ground disturbing activities. Proposed western portions of the alignment that cross a railroad will be constructed aboveground along previously-installed CenturyLink telecommunication poles. This activity will require no ground disturbance; however, use of a 16.5-foot construction easement, as well as a 10 foot permanent easement, will be required for routine operations and maintenance activities in the future.
The project is funded by monies from Rural Utilities Services (RUS); because Federal funds are being used, this project is considered an undertaking and is subject to Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA), as amended. 
Class I information will be used by RUS to determine what portions of the alignment require Class III cultural resources inventory. Current industry standards recommend that surveys conducted within ten years of a project date and conducted in compliance with SHPO and Agency standards provide sufficient Class III coverage. Projects older than ten years are generally considered out of date with current survey standards.

The engineering plans and specifications will identify the major design elements, dimensions, geospatial placement including relative elevations, and materials. A draft design will be provided to the Client for review and comments. The final design will include all engineering drawings with technical specifications included on a notes page in the drawing set. Per the Owner’s direction, a bid package and construction contract documents are not included with this project. All final plans will bear the stamp of a New Mexico licensed Professional Engineer.",10245.04,10245.04,2018-06-28T00:00:00,2018-12-31T00:00:00,USA,NM,541620,,N,2,Unrestricted,Non-Competed,Time and Materials,,"Guadalupe Soil & Water Conservation District

Beal Lake Conservation Area Expansion (Beal) and Cibola National Wildlife Refuge Expansion (Cibola) are both part of the Lower Colorado River Multi-Species Conservation Program (LCR MSCP).  The LCR MSCP is a 50-year multi-stakeholder, Federal and non-Federal partnership responding to the need to balance the use of Lower Colorado River (LCR) water resources and the conservation of native species and their habitats in compliance with the Endangered Species Act.  A goal of the LCR MSCP is to conserve and work toward the recovery of state and federally-listed species, and protect and maintain wildlife habitat along the LCR from Lake Mead to the southern international boundary with Mexico.  A major component of the LCR MSCP is the creation and management of native plant habitat; various native plant species will be established at these loci including planting of cottonwood and willow trees.
